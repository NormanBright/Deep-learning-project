In this paper, two deep networks are used to analyse a dataset which are ResNet and VGG16. Both models will be investigated below.The chosen dataset is the MNIST dataset which is a collection of handwritten digits. The training and testing procedure will be analysed. In addition, a comparison will be made between the two different deep networks (ResNet and VGG16) in regards of quality of the output, train and test accuracy, and loss changing during training periods
